# Movie Recommandation System:
A recommendation system is a subclass of Information filtering Systems that seeks to predict the rating or the preference a user might give to an item. In simple words, it is an algorithm that suggests relevant items to users. Eg: In the case of Netflix which movie to watch, In the case of e-commerce which product to buy, or In the case of kindle which book to read, etc.

## Types of Recommandation System:
### 1. Content-Based Filtering:
In this type of recommendation system, relevant items are shown using the content of the previously searched items by the users. Here content refers to the attribute/tag of the product that the user like. In this type of system, products are tagged using certain keywords, then the system tries to understand what the user wants and it looks in its database and finally tries to recommend different products that the user wants.

### 2. Collaborative Based Filtering:
Recommending the new items to users based on the interest and preference of other similar users is basically collaborative-based filtering. For eg:- When we shop on Amazon it recommends new products saying “Customer who brought this also brought” as shown below.

In this project we are using the content based approach to recommend the movies to the user by using the tags.
